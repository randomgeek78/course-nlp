       "xxbos i did n't know what to expect when i started watching this movie , by the end of it i was pulling my hairs out . xxmaj this was one of the most pathetic movies of this year ... in fact , in the last ten years . xxmaj david xxmaj dhawan should just give up his career as a director . i am yet to come across one original script that xxmaj david xxmaj dhawan has worked on . xxmaj this one was a complete bit y bit rip off xxmaj hitch . i have nothing against remakes as such , but this one is just so lousy that it makes you even hate the original one ( which was pretty decent ) . i fail to understand what actors like xxmaj salman and xxmaj govinda saw in this script . i read somewhere , that this was supposed to be xxmaj govinda 's comeback vehicle . xxmaj if that s true , then only xxmaj god can save his career . xxmaj salman just overacted to the hilt . xxmaj govinda who i think is an actor of very high caliber was completely wasted . xxmaj katrina xxmaj kaif and lara xxmaj dutta had nothing to do apart form wearing designer clothes and smiling for no rhyme or reason . xxmaj please stay away form this one !,xxbos xxmaj for several reasons , this movie is simply awful . xxmaj other posters have listed some of this movie 's historical errors . xxmaj well , i have a layman 's knowledge of xxmaj roman history and even i found the inaccuracies flagrant . i usually forgive errors in historical movies because i understand that the purpose is to entertain not educate . xxmaj and shrinking a long saga down to a two hour feature requires some , let 's say , historical license . xxmaj but this movie goes well beyond mere rounding . \n",

' xxmaj mojo ' uses a technique for shooting the 1950s often seen in films that stresses the physical differences to our own time but also represents dialogue in a highly exaggerated fashion ( owing much to the way that speech was represented in films made in that period ) ; i have no idea if people actually spoke like this outside of the movies , but no films made today and set in contemporary times use such stylised language . xxmaj it 's as if the stilted discourse of 1950s screenwriters serves a common shorthand for a past that seems , in consequence , a very distant country indeed ; and therefore stresses the particular , rather than the universal , in the story . ' xxmaj mojo ' features a strong performance from xxmaj ian xxmaj hart and annoying ones from xxmaj aiden xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj ewan xxmaj bremner , the latter still struggling to build a xxunk ' career ; but feels like a period piece , a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an outdated idiom . xxmaj rather dull , actually .,xxbos i have to say , as a xxup bsg fan i was n't exactly sure what i 'd think of this show . i saw it on the big screen at the xxmaj xxunk cinema tonight ( as part of the xxmaj xxunk xxmaj center screenings ) , and the cast and film makers spoke after - wards . xxmaj ron xxmaj moore said they ' wanted to make a clean break from xxmaj battlestar , and do something different , and that yes they would lose some fans but hopefully they 'd gain others \" . \n",

       "  i loved it . xxmaj it was really very good . i guess i 'm a true sci - fi ( or ' syfy ' - do i really have to type that ? ) geek , because i 'd totally watch this as a series . xxmaj it has a strong and rich story , and kept my interest . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj it starts with a small group of teenagers plotting something , which to me was the weakest part and a bit confusing . xxmaj the actor playing \" xxmaj ben \" should have given us more of a glimpse into his intense beliefs . xxmaj the actress playing \" xxmaj zoe \" seemed a little xxunk , but she was playing a teenager ( and i 'm sure i wo n't be the only one who thought \" xxmaj zoe \" was a cylon at first , perils of being a xxup bsg geek ) . xxmaj if they 're hoping these will be the new xxmaj bamber / xxmaj xxunk / xxmaj park , they may want to rethink it . xxmaj surprisingly , it was the adults that captured the audiences attention . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj eric xxmaj stoltz gives a stellar performance as xxmaj daniel xxmaj xxunk , a man so haunted by his family tragedy that he jumps at the first chance of getting out of his grief and does n't let go . xxmaj he does a chilling and enthralling job of conveying his character 's sly knowledge of the inner world of computers and people , especially in a scene in which he spins a web for the young teenage friend of his daughters , traps her , then dismisses and releases her . xxmaj no sign at all of the ' serial killer ' he played on xxmaj gray 's xxmaj anatomy , really impressive acting . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj equally as strong though not in it nearly as much is xxmaj paula xxmaj xxunk as his wife xxmaj amanda xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj she is just as smart and well written and beautifully played as xxmaj stoltz 's part , and i completely believed that they are a couple , and a couple that have been together forever and have a strong relationship , something rarely seen these days . i look forward to seeing what happens with this family , and hope they give her as much to do as xxmaj roslin in xxup xxunk she is strong and smart and when she lashes out at her kid , you cringe , it 's really great . xxmaj not to mention her eyes , which could hold magical powers , that 's how intense they are . xxmaj the scene where she takes on the government xxunk very short scene , but beautifully xxunk really gives you an idea of her power . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the other part of the show that did not work 100 % for me were the scenes with xxmaj esai xxmaj morales , and the mafia type clan of his . xxmaj he does a good job overall , but i did not believe in this mobs power , nor intimidated by their threats . i found myself wishing that this whole story line was a bit more mysterious and hard to figure out ; the way it is presented is almost an homage to the xxmaj godfather , they kind of hit you over the head with it a bit . xxmaj but given time , i can see how this will develop into an interesting ' xxmaj upstairs / downstairs ' kind of thing , with the poor minorities ( xxmaj morales et al ) versus the rich folk who rule the planet ( xxmaj stolz et al ) . xxmaj and to be honest , i did enjoy it when he spoke to his son about the origin of their name- that was a very well played scene . \n",

       "  xxmaj note to xxup bsg fans , the boy playing ' xxmaj willy xxmaj adama ' does n't really look much like xxmaj olmos , but he 's just a kid . xxmaj whether or not he 'll be featured any more than he was in this film , who knows ? i sure could n't tell . xxmaj but it did n't bother me , because he was n't as interesting as everything else going on around him . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj polly xxmaj walker plays ' xxmaj sister xxmaj clarice ' , and she 's chilling and odd in every scene she 's in . i 'm not sure where she 'll go or who she 'll end up with , but i was very impressed with her acting . xxmaj in this film she was sort of on the side , but obviously being set up to play a very important part later on . xxmaj she was nothing like her character in \" xxmaj rome \" , something i always find impressive in actors . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj one nice xxunk the music is actually better and less obvious than xxup bsg , even though it 's the same guy doing it , xxmaj bear xxunk . xxmaj it has a haunting and unusual approach that took me by surprise , i 'd buy this score if i had the chance . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj as to the ' panel discussion ' after the show , it was hosted by xxmaj seth xxmaj green . xxmaj ron xxmaj moore was very smart and articulate , xxmaj david xxmaj xxunk was cracking wise ( much like his video diaries ) , xxmaj esai xxmaj morales told a long story about how he was cast , and xxmaj eric xxmaj stoltz was very funny and did n't really answer the questions ( but i 've always had a thing for him ) . xxmaj paula xxmaj xxunk was tough ( she took xxmaj seth xxmaj green to task for mistakenly saying she was on ' 24 ' ) , and the girls who played xxmaj zooey and xxmaj lacey were both darling . xxmaj grace xxmaj park and xxmaj tricia xxmaj xxunk were there as well , answering questions about how they did the scenes acting with themselves on xxup bsg . xxmaj overall a very interesting and wonderful evening . \n",

' xxmaj mojo ' uses a technique for shooting the 1950s often seen in films that stresses the physical differences to our own time but also represents dialogue in a highly exaggerated fashion ( owing much to the way that speech was represented in films made in that period ) ; i have no idea if people actually spoke like this outside of the movies , but no films made today and set in contemporary times use such stylised language . xxmaj it 's as if the stilted discourse of 1950s screenwriters serves a common shorthand for a past that seems , in consequence , a very distant country indeed ; and therefore stresses the particular , rather than the universal , in the story . ' xxmaj mojo ' features a strong performance from xxmaj ian xxmaj hart and annoying ones from xxmaj aiden xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj ewan xxmaj bremner , the latter still struggling to build a xxunk ' career ; but feels like a period piece , a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an outdated idiom . xxmaj rather dull , actually .,xxbos i have to say , as a xxup bsg fan i was n't exactly sure what i 'd think of this show . i saw it on the big screen at the xxmaj xxunk cinema tonight ( as part of the xxmaj xxunk xxmaj center screenings ) , and the cast and film makers spoke after - wards . xxmaj ron xxmaj moore said they ' wanted to make a clean break from xxmaj battlestar , and do something different , and that yes they would lose some fans but hopefully they 'd gain others \" . \n",

' xxmaj mojo ' uses a technique for shooting the 1950s often seen in films that stresses the physical differences to our own time but also represents dialogue in a highly exaggerated fashion ( owing much to the way that speech was represented in films made in that period ) ; i have no idea if people actually spoke like this outside of the movies , but no films made today and set in contemporary times use such stylised language . xxmaj it 's as if the stilted discourse of 1950s screenwriters serves a common shorthand for a past that seems , in consequence , a very distant country indeed ; and therefore stresses the particular , rather than the universal , in the story . ' xxmaj mojo ' features a strong performance from xxmaj ian xxmaj hart and annoying ones from xxmaj aiden xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj ewan xxmaj bremner , the latter still struggling to build a xxunk ' career ; but feels like a period piece , a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an outdated idiom . xxmaj rather dull , actually .,xxbos i have to say , as a xxup bsg fan i was n't exactly sure what i 'd think of this show . i saw it on the big screen at the xxmaj xxunk cinema tonight ( as part of the xxmaj xxunk xxmaj center screenings ) , and the cast and film makers spoke after - wards . xxmaj ron xxmaj moore said they ' wanted to make a clean break from xxmaj battlestar , and do something different , and that yes they would lose some fans but hopefully they 'd gain others \" . \n",

' xxmaj mojo ' uses a technique for shooting the 1950s often seen in films that stresses the physical differences to our own time but also represents dialogue in a highly exaggerated fashion ( owing much to the way that speech was represented in films made in that period ) ; i have no idea if people actually spoke like this outside of the movies , but no films made today and set in contemporary times use such stylised language . xxmaj it 's as if the stilted discourse of 1950s screenwriters serves a common shorthand for a past that seems , in consequence , a very distant country indeed ; and therefore stresses the particular , rather than the universal , in the story . ' xxmaj mojo ' features a strong performance from xxmaj ian xxmaj hart and annoying ones from xxmaj aiden xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj ewan xxmaj bremner , the latter still struggling to build a xxunk ' career ; but feels like a period piece , a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an outdated idiom . xxmaj rather dull , actually .,xxbos i have to say , as a xxup bsg fan i was n't exactly sure what i 'd think of this show . i saw it on the big screen at the xxmaj xxunk cinema tonight ( as part of the xxmaj xxunk xxmaj center screenings ) , and the cast and film makers spoke after - wards . xxmaj ron xxmaj moore said they ' wanted to make a clean break from xxmaj battlestar , and do something different , and that yes they would lose some fans but hopefully they 'd gain others \" . \n",

       "  xxmaj equally as strong though not in it nearly as much is xxmaj paula xxmaj xxunk as his wife xxmaj amanda xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj she is just as smart and well written and beautifully played as xxmaj stoltz 's part , and i completely believed that they are a couple , and a couple that have been together forever and have a strong relationship , something rarely seen these days . i look forward to seeing what happens with this family , and hope they give her as much to do as xxmaj roslin in xxup xxunk she is strong and smart and when she lashes out at her kid , you cringe , it 's really great . xxmaj not to mention her eyes , which could hold magical powers , that 's how intense they are . xxmaj the scene where she takes on the government xxunk very short scene , but beautifully xxunk really gives you an idea of her power . \n",

       "  xxmaj the other part of the show that did not work 100 % for me were the scenes with xxmaj esai xxmaj morales , and the mafia type clan of his . xxmaj he does a good job overall , but i did not believe in this mobs power , nor intimidated by their threats . i found myself wishing that this whole story line was a bit more mysterious and hard to figure out ; the way it is presented is almost an homage to the xxmaj godfather , they kind of hit you over the head with it a bit . xxmaj but given time , i can see how this will develop into an interesting ' xxmaj upstairs / downstairs ' kind of thing , with the poor minorities ( xxmaj morales et al ) versus the rich folk who rule the planet ( xxmaj stolz et al ) . xxmaj and to be honest , i did enjoy it when he spoke to his son about the origin of their name- that was a very well played scene . \n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj as to the ' panel discussion ' after the show , it was hosted by xxmaj seth xxmaj green . xxmaj ron xxmaj moore was very smart and articulate , xxmaj david xxmaj xxunk was cracking wise ( much like his video diaries ) , xxmaj esai xxmaj morales told a long story about how he was cast , and xxmaj eric xxmaj stoltz was very funny and did n't really answer the questions ( but i 've always had a thing for him ) . xxmaj paula xxmaj xxunk was tough ( she took xxmaj seth xxmaj green to task for mistakenly saying she was on ' 24 ' ) , and the girls who played xxmaj zooey and xxmaj lacey were both darling . xxmaj grace xxmaj park and xxmaj tricia xxmaj xxunk were there as well , answering questions about how they did the scenes acting with themselves on xxup bsg . xxmaj overall a very interesting and wonderful evening . \n",

       "  xxmaj quentin xxmaj tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to xxmaj america through his xxmaj rolling xxmaj thunder xxmaj productions company , though i can not for the life of me figure out why a man with his talent would bother . xxmaj he was known to have remarked , \" i 'm happy to love a movie this much . \" a lot of us , though , hope he will concentrate on making his audiences happy with more worthwhile discoveries in the future .,xxbos i had never heard of this film till it popped up on cable xxup tv and i ca n't understand why . xxmaj geena outdoes xxmaj arnold as an action hero in this film ! xxmaj geena is an ex - xxup cia assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a schoolteacher with a quiet family life in a rural town . xxmaj she continues that life for 8 years with a husband and daughter . xxmaj clues start coming to her that she may have been someone else , especially when someone tries to kill her . xxmaj it seems that her former employers have discovered that she never died and want to make sure that she does . xxmaj she hires xxmaj samuel xxup l. xxmaj jackson , who is a former police officer . xxmaj together they form a pair that is as entertaining as xxmaj mel xxmaj gibson & xxmaj danny xxmaj glover . xxmaj when xxmaj geena finally regains her memory she undergoes a transformation into the killing machine she once was with the song \" xxmaj she 's xxmaj not xxmaj there \" playing in the background . xxmaj what follows is xxmaj geena and xxmaj samuel have to go after the bad guys and hopefully stay alive . xxmaj all through the rest of the film xxmaj geena has to decide who she really is . xxmaj the killing unfeeling machine ? xxmaj the mother / schoolteacher with the quiet family life ? xxmaj or a combination of both ? xxmaj especially , since the bad guys grab xxmaj geena 's daughter . xxmaj great action scenes that rank up with any of the xxmaj die xxmaj hard movies !,xxbos ' xxmaj mojo ' is a story of fifties xxmaj london , a world of budding rock stars , violence and forced homosexuality . ' xxmaj mojo ' uses a technique for shooting the 1950s often seen in films that stresses the physical differences to our own time but also represents dialogue in a highly exaggerated fashion ( owing much to the way that speech was represented in films made in that period ) ; i have no idea if people actually spoke like this outside of the movies , but no films made today and set in contemporary times use such stylised language . xxmaj it 's as if the stilted discourse of 1950s screenwriters serves a common shorthand for a past that seems , in consequence , a very distant country indeed ; and therefore stresses the particular , rather than the universal , in the story . ' xxmaj mojo ' features a strong performance from xxmaj ian xxmaj hart and annoying ones from xxmaj aiden xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj ewan xxmaj bremner , the latter still struggling to build a xxunk ' career ; but feels like a period piece , a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an outdated idiom . xxmaj rather dull , actually .,xxbos i have to say , as a xxup bsg fan i was n't exactly sure what i 'd think of this show . i saw it on the big screen at the xxmaj xxunk cinema tonight ( as part of the xxmaj xxunk xxmaj center screenings ) , and the cast and film makers spoke after - wards . xxmaj ron xxmaj moore said they ' wanted to make a clean break from xxmaj battlestar , and do something different , and that yes they would lose some fans but hopefully they 'd gain others \" . \n",

       "  i loved it . xxmaj it was really very good . i guess i 'm a true sci - fi ( or ' syfy ' - do i really have to type that ? ) geek , because i 'd totally watch this as a series . xxmaj it has a strong and rich story , and kept my interest . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj it starts with a small group of teenagers plotting something , which to me was the weakest part and a bit confusing . xxmaj the actor playing \" xxmaj ben \" should have given us more of a glimpse into his intense beliefs . xxmaj the actress playing \" xxmaj zoe \" seemed a little xxunk , but she was playing a teenager ( and i 'm sure i wo n't be the only one who thought \" xxmaj zoe \" was a cylon at first , perils of being a xxup bsg geek ) . xxmaj if they 're hoping these will be the new xxmaj bamber / xxmaj xxunk / xxmaj park , they may want to rethink it . xxmaj surprisingly , it was the adults that captured the audiences attention . \n",

       "  xxmaj eric xxmaj stoltz gives a stellar performance as xxmaj daniel xxmaj xxunk , a man so haunted by his family tragedy that he jumps at the first chance of getting out of his grief and does n't let go . xxmaj he does a chilling and enthralling job of conveying his character 's sly knowledge of the inner world of computers and people , especially in a scene in which he spins a web for the young teenage friend of his daughters , traps her , then dismisses and releases her . xxmaj no sign at all of the ' serial killer ' he played on xxmaj gray 's xxmaj anatomy , really impressive acting . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj equally as strong though not in it nearly as much is xxmaj paula xxmaj xxunk as his wife xxmaj amanda xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj she is just as smart and well written and beautifully played as xxmaj stoltz 's part , and i completely believed that they are a couple , and a couple that have been together forever and have a strong relationship , something rarely seen these days . i look forward to seeing what happens with this family , and hope they give her as much to do as xxmaj roslin in xxup xxunk she is strong and smart and when she lashes out at her kid , you cringe , it 's really great . xxmaj not to mention her eyes , which could hold magical powers , that 's how intense they are . xxmaj the scene where she takes on the government xxunk very short scene , but beautifully xxunk really gives you an idea of her power . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the other part of the show that did not work 100 % for me were the scenes with xxmaj esai xxmaj morales , and the mafia type clan of his . xxmaj he does a good job overall , but i did not believe in this mobs power , nor intimidated by their threats . i found myself wishing that this whole story line was a bit more mysterious and hard to figure out ; the way it is presented is almost an homage to the xxmaj godfather , they kind of hit you over the head with it a bit . xxmaj but given time , i can see how this will develop into an interesting ' xxmaj upstairs / downstairs ' kind of thing , with the poor minorities ( xxmaj morales et al ) versus the rich folk who rule the planet ( xxmaj stolz et al ) . xxmaj and to be honest , i did enjoy it when he spoke to his son about the origin of their name- that was a very well played scene . \n",

' xxmaj mojo ' uses a technique for shooting the 1950s often seen in films that stresses the physical differences to our own time but also represents dialogue in a highly exaggerated fashion ( owing much to the way that speech was represented in films made in that period ) ; i have no idea if people actually spoke like this outside of the movies , but no films made today and set in contemporary times use such stylised language . xxmaj it 's as if the stilted discourse of 1950s screenwriters serves a common shorthand for a past that seems , in consequence , a very distant country indeed ; and therefore stresses the particular , rather than the universal , in the story . ' xxmaj mojo ' features a strong performance from xxmaj ian xxmaj hart and annoying ones from xxmaj aiden xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj ewan xxmaj bremner , the latter still struggling to build a xxunk ' career ; but feels like a period piece , a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an outdated idiom . xxmaj rather dull , actually .,xxbos i have to say , as a xxup bsg fan i was n't exactly sure what i 'd think of this show . i saw it on the big screen at the xxmaj xxunk cinema tonight ( as part of the xxmaj xxunk xxmaj center screenings ) , and the cast and film makers spoke after - wards . xxmaj ron xxmaj moore said they ' wanted to make a clean break from xxmaj battlestar , and do something different , and that yes they would lose some fans but hopefully they 'd gain others \" . \n",

       "  xxmaj there 's worse . xxmaj to tell a story from a distant period , the movie uses flashbacks which just make the story more confusing . xxmaj unless viewers have some prior knowledge of the period , they will quickly be lost . xxmaj in addition , the movie was obviously filmed simultaneously in xxmaj italian and xxmaj english with various actors being dubbed later . xxmaj at times , the actors seem as if they were in completely different movies which were then edited together . xxmaj in fact , this is not far wrong . xxmaj the actors were obviously pasted onto a cheesy computer generated ancient xxmaj rome . \n",

' xxmaj mojo ' uses a technique for shooting the 1950s often seen in films that stresses the physical differences to our own time but also represents dialogue in a highly exaggerated fashion ( owing much to the way that speech was represented in films made in that period ) ; i have no idea if people actually spoke like this outside of the movies , but no films made today and set in contemporary times use such stylised language . xxmaj it 's as if the stilted discourse of 1950s screenwriters serves a common shorthand for a past that seems , in consequence , a very distant country indeed ; and therefore stresses the particular , rather than the universal , in the story . ' xxmaj mojo ' features a strong performance from xxmaj ian xxmaj hart and annoying ones from xxmaj aiden xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj ewan xxmaj bremner , the latter still struggling to build a xxunk ' career ; but feels like a period piece , a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an outdated idiom . xxmaj rather dull , actually .,xxbos i have to say , as a xxup bsg fan i was n't exactly sure what i 'd think of this show . i saw it on the big screen at the xxmaj xxunk cinema tonight ( as part of the xxmaj xxunk xxmaj center screenings ) , and the cast and film makers spoke after - wards . xxmaj ron xxmaj moore said they ' wanted to make a clean break from xxmaj battlestar , and do something different , and that yes they would lose some fans but hopefully they 'd gain others \" . \n",

       "  xxmaj the picture quality and sound quality are poor in this film . xxmaj the story is interspersed with musical numbers but the songs are bad and xxmaj kathryn xxmaj crawford has a terrible voice . xxmaj rogers is n't that good either . xxmaj he 's pleasant enough but only really comes to life when playing the drums or trombone . xxmaj there is a very irritating character who plays a cab driver ( xxmaj roscoe xxmaj karns ) and the film is just dull .,xxbos ( xxunk one truly memorable part of this otherwise rather dull and tepid bit of xxmaj british cuisine is xxmaj steiner 's henna rinse , one of the worst dye jobs ever . xxmaj that , and the magnificent caterpillar eyebrows on the old evil dude who was trying to steal xxmaj steiner 's invention . xxup mst3 k does an admirable job of making a wretchedly boring and grey film funny . i particularly like it when xxmaj crow kills xxmaj mike with his ' touch of death ' , and when he revives him in the theatre , xxmaj mike cries \" xxmaj guys , i died , i saw eternal truth and beauty ! oh , it 's this movie ... \" xxmaj that would be a letdown , having to come back from the afterlife to watch the rest of xxmaj the xxmaj projected xxmaj man . xxmaj the film could make a fortune being sold as a sleep aide . xxmaj some of the puns in the film were wicked : police xxunk ! \" xxunk , is n't it ? \" police xxunk 's lowe , all right \" xxmaj tom xxunk low , right down by the floor ! \" police xxunk i get on ? \" xxmaj tom xxunk 's dead , but knock yourself out \" xxup mst3 k is definitely the only way to watch this snoozer .,xxbos i have seen it . xxmaj it 's not \" good \" but interesting in an understated way . xxmaj the boys in it are quite naturalistic but xxrep 16 . the graphic / gratuitous final gang rape scene is repugnant and -oh xxunk the arbitrary insertion of second world war footage is offensive in the way it attempts to compare real horror with this misogynistic contrivance . xxmaj real atrocity is xxunk this film is just atrocious . xxmaj however , the film has a look which can draw you in . xxmaj but it seems to me that is the \" xxmaj emperor 's xxmaj new xxmaj clothes \" , but in fact in reverse . xxmaj the film looks good , but the direction , story , content and final feeling you take away from this film is vacuous . xxmaj if a feeling can be vacuous - this is it .,xxbos xxmaj and i repeat , please do not see this movie ! xxmaj this is more than a review . xxmaj this is a warning . xxmaj this sets the record for the worst , most effortless comedy ever made . xxmaj at least with most of the recent comedies nowadays , the gags are crude and flat , but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny . i never get tired of repeating one of my favorite xxunk : xxmaj everyone thinks they can do comedy , and only 10 percent of them are right . xxmaj comedy is hard ! xxmaj this is not some genre any fool can play around with . i think it 's atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to \" xxmaj kentucky xxmaj fried xxmaj movie . \" xxmaj basically , these bozos are comparing their so - called comic talents to those of the brilliant xxmaj jim xxmaj abrahams and the xxmaj zucker xxmaj brothers . xxmaj come on , i 've seen xxmaj pauly xxmaj shore movies that are 10 times funnier than \" xxmaj the xxmaj underground xxmaj comedy xxmaj movie . \" xxmaj here 's a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie : xxmaj one sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj the whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen . xxmaj that 's it . xxmaj that 's the whole joke . xxmaj wow . xxmaj this is enough to make xxmaj carrot xxmaj top roll his eyes . xxmaj another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie . xxmaj and in another sketch , there 's a bag lady beauty contest , in which we 're exposed to the horrible sights of bikini - clad middle - aged women with beer guts and stretch marks . xxmaj plus , making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny . xxmaj it 's a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped . xxmaj the whole movie is supposed to be a satire . i think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire ... is xxup truth ! ! ! xxmaj for anybody who actually enjoyed this crap , explain to me what is truthful about xxup any of these gags ! xxmaj some of the sketches might 've sounded funny on paper , but anybody who 's taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper , it probably wo n't be funny on screen . xxmaj if i tell someone about a big , black , muscular gay virgin , who 's saving himself for the right man , he or she would probably laugh . xxmaj but watching the premise played out on screen for about 10 minutes is a complete drag . i hate how whenever people criticize a low - brow comedy like this for not being funny , they 're regarded as stuck - up squares . i just saw \" xxmaj white xxmaj chicks \" recently . xxmaj that 's another low - brow , politically incorrect comedy , but i laughed my head off . xxmaj the most offensive thing about \" xxmaj the xxmaj underground xxmaj comedy xxmaj movie \" is it 's not funny ! xxmaj what the writers and directors do n't understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless does n't work . xxmaj there has to be more ! xxmaj just think of the famous scene from \" xxmaj there 's xxmaj something xxmaj about xxmaj mary \" ( ironically , enough the bozo filmmakers put the xxmaj farrellys on their special thanks list ) . xxmaj the joke about the semen was n't just funny because it involved bodily fluids . xxmaj there was a buildup . xxmaj ben xxmaj stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he did n't go out on a date with a \" loaded gun . \" xxmaj then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released . a knock is on the door , and he has to answer it . xxmaj his date , xxmaj mary , is at the door and that 's when it 's revealed that the semen is hanging off xxmaj ben 's ear . xxmaj in this movie , there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people , with no buildup whatsoever . xxmaj as xxmaj jay xxmaj leno always says , \" xxmaj this comedy thing 's not so easy , is it ? \" xxmaj keep that in mind , xxmaj vince xxmaj offer , 'cause you were n't cut out for this genre ! ! xxmaj the only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip . xxmaj let 's face it , nowadays it 's hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect . i know comedy is subjective ... but this movie should n't be funny to anybody , except maybe the filmmakers themselves . xxmaj as a side note , the movie had to have been made before xxmaj michael xxmaj clarke xxmaj duncan 's fame in movies like \" xxmaj armageddon \" and \" xxmaj the xxmaj green xxmaj mile . \" xxmaj there ca n't be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show . xxmaj all the others in the cast are either non - actors , has - been actors or b - movie stars . xxmaj karen xxmaj black made a good impression in \" xxmaj five xxmaj easy xxmaj pieces , \" but i do n't think she 's done anything of value ever since . xxmaj slash was probably drugged into being in this film . xxmaj gina xxmaj lee xxmaj xxunk is nothing without \" xxmaj baywatch . \" xxmaj xxunk is the film 's biggest star ( keeping in mind xxmaj duncan was n't famous at the time ) , and there are still probably a ton of people who have n't heard of her -- for good reason . xxmaj usually , i 'm in support of extremely low - budget flicks , but this one deserves to drift into obscurity . i hope to xxmaj lord this does n't become a cult classic ! xxmaj should n't there be a law against distributing crap like this ?\n",

\" xxmaj keep that in mind , xxmaj vince xxmaj offer , 'cause you were n't cut out for this genre ! ! xxmaj the only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip . xxmaj let 's face it , nowadays it 's hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect . i know comedy is subjective ... but this movie should n't be funny to anybody , except maybe the filmmakers themselves . xxmaj as a side note , the movie had to have been made before xxmaj michael xxmaj clarke xxmaj duncan 's fame in movies like \" xxmaj armageddon \" and \" xxmaj the xxmaj green xxmaj mile . \" xxmaj there ca n't be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show . xxmaj all the others in the cast are either non - actors , has - been actors or b - movie stars . xxmaj karen xxmaj black made a good impression in \" xxmaj five xxmaj easy xxmaj pieces , \" but i do n't think she 's done anything of value ever since . xxmaj slash was probably drugged into being in this film . xxmaj gina xxmaj lee xxmaj xxunk is nothing without \" xxmaj baywatch . \" xxmaj xxunk is the film 's biggest star ( keeping in mind xxmaj duncan was n't famous at the time ) , and there are still probably a ton of people who have n't heard of her -- for good reason . xxmaj usually , i 'm in support of extremely low - budget flicks , but this one deserves to drift into obscurity . i hope to xxmaj lord this does n't become a cult classic ! xxmaj should n't there be a law against distributing crap like this ?\n",

\" police xxunk 's lowe , all right \" xxmaj tom xxunk low , right down by the floor ! \" police xxunk i get on ? \" xxmaj tom xxunk 's dead , but knock yourself out \" xxup mst3 k is definitely the only way to watch this snoozer .,xxbos i have seen it . xxmaj it 's not \" good \" but interesting in an understated way . xxmaj the boys in it are quite naturalistic but xxrep 16 . the graphic / gratuitous final gang rape scene is repugnant and -oh xxunk the arbitrary insertion of second world war footage is offensive in the way it attempts to compare real horror with this misogynistic contrivance . xxmaj real atrocity is xxunk this film is just atrocious . xxmaj however , the film has a look which can draw you in . xxmaj but it seems to me that is the \" xxmaj emperor 's xxmaj new xxmaj clothes \" , but in fact in reverse . xxmaj the film looks good , but the direction , story , content and final feeling you take away from this film is vacuous . xxmaj if a feeling can be vacuous - this is it .,xxbos xxmaj and i repeat , please do not see this movie ! xxmaj this is more than a review . xxmaj this is a warning . xxmaj this sets the record for the worst , most effortless comedy ever made . xxmaj at least with most of the recent comedies nowadays , the gags are crude and flat , but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny . i never get tired of repeating one of my favorite xxunk : xxmaj everyone thinks they can do comedy , and only 10 percent of them are right . xxmaj comedy is hard ! xxmaj this is not some genre any fool can play around with . i think it 's atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to \" xxmaj kentucky xxmaj fried xxmaj movie . \" xxmaj basically , these bozos are comparing their so - called comic talents to those of the brilliant xxmaj jim xxmaj abrahams and the xxmaj zucker xxmaj brothers . xxmaj come on , i 've seen xxmaj pauly xxmaj shore movies that are 10 times funnier than \" xxmaj the xxmaj underground xxmaj comedy xxmaj movie . \" xxmaj here 's a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie : xxmaj one sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj the whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen . xxmaj that 's it . xxmaj that 's the whole joke . xxmaj wow . xxmaj this is enough to make xxmaj carrot xxmaj top roll his eyes . xxmaj another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie . xxmaj and in another sketch , there 's a bag lady beauty contest , in which we 're exposed to the horrible sights of bikini - clad middle - aged women with beer guts and stretch marks . xxmaj plus , making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny . xxmaj it 's a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped . xxmaj the whole movie is supposed to be a satire . i think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire ... is xxup truth ! ! ! xxmaj for anybody who actually enjoyed this crap , explain to me what is truthful about xxup any of these gags ! xxmaj some of the sketches might 've sounded funny on paper , but anybody who 's taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper , it probably wo n't be funny on screen . xxmaj if i tell someone about a big , black , muscular gay virgin , who 's saving himself for the right man , he or she would probably laugh . xxmaj but watching the premise played out on screen for about 10 minutes is a complete drag . i hate how whenever people criticize a low - brow comedy like this for not being funny , they 're regarded as stuck - up squares . i just saw \" xxmaj white xxmaj chicks \" recently . xxmaj that 's another low - brow , politically incorrect comedy , but i laughed my head off . xxmaj the most offensive thing about \" xxmaj the xxmaj underground xxmaj comedy xxmaj movie \" is it 's not funny ! xxmaj what the writers and directors do n't understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless does n't work . xxmaj there has to be more ! xxmaj just think of the famous scene from \" xxmaj there 's xxmaj something xxmaj about xxmaj mary \" ( ironically , enough the bozo filmmakers put the xxmaj farrellys on their special thanks list ) . xxmaj the joke about the semen was n't just funny because it involved bodily fluids . xxmaj there was a buildup . xxmaj ben xxmaj stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he did n't go out on a date with a \" loaded gun . \" xxmaj then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released . a knock is on the door , and he has to answer it . xxmaj his date , xxmaj mary , is at the door and that 's when it 's revealed that the semen is hanging off xxmaj ben 's ear . xxmaj in this movie , there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people , with no buildup whatsoever . xxmaj as xxmaj jay xxmaj leno always says , \" xxmaj this comedy thing 's not so easy , is it ? \" xxmaj keep that in mind , xxmaj vince xxmaj offer , 'cause you were n't cut out for this genre ! ! xxmaj the only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip . xxmaj let 's face it , nowadays it 's hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect . i know comedy is subjective ... but this movie should n't be funny to anybody , except maybe the filmmakers themselves . xxmaj as a side note , the movie had to have been made before xxmaj michael xxmaj clarke xxmaj duncan 's fame in movies like \" xxmaj armageddon \" and \" xxmaj the xxmaj green xxmaj mile . \" xxmaj there ca n't be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show . xxmaj all the others in the cast are either non - actors , has - been actors or b - movie stars . xxmaj karen xxmaj black made a good impression in \" xxmaj five xxmaj easy xxmaj pieces , \" but i do n't think she 's done anything of value ever since . xxmaj slash was probably drugged into being in this film . xxmaj gina xxmaj lee xxmaj xxunk is nothing without \" xxmaj baywatch . \" xxmaj xxunk is the film 's biggest star ( keeping in mind xxmaj duncan was n't famous at the time ) , and there are still probably a ton of people who have n't heard of her -- for good reason . xxmaj usually , i 'm in support of extremely low - budget flicks , but this one deserves to drift into obscurity . i hope to xxmaj lord this does n't become a cult classic ! xxmaj should n't there be a law against distributing crap like this ?\n",

       "xxbos i did n't know what to expect when i started watching this movie , by the end of it i was pulling my hairs out . xxmaj this was one of the most pathetic movies of this year ... in fact , in the last ten years . xxmaj david xxmaj dhawan should just give up his career as a director . i am yet to come across one original script that xxmaj david xxmaj dhawan has worked on . xxmaj this one was a complete bit y bit rip off xxmaj hitch . i have nothing against remakes as such , but this one is just so lousy that it makes you even hate the original one ( which was pretty decent ) . i fail to understand what actors like xxmaj salman and xxmaj govinda saw in this script . i read somewhere , that this was supposed to be xxmaj govinda 's comeback vehicle . xxmaj if that s true , then only xxmaj god can save his career . xxmaj salman just overacted to the hilt . xxmaj govinda who i think is an actor of very high caliber was completely wasted . xxmaj katrina xxmaj kaif and lara xxmaj dutta had nothing to do apart form wearing designer clothes and smiling for no rhyme or reason . xxmaj please stay away form this one !,xxbos xxmaj for several reasons , this movie is simply awful . xxmaj other posters have listed some of this movie 's historical errors . xxmaj well , i have a layman 's knowledge of xxmaj roman history and even i found the inaccuracies flagrant . i usually forgive errors in historical movies because i understand that the purpose is to entertain not educate . xxmaj and shrinking a long saga down to a two hour feature requires some , let 's say , historical license . xxmaj but this movie goes well beyond mere rounding . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj there 's worse . xxmaj to tell a story from a distant period , the movie uses flashbacks which just make the story more confusing . xxmaj unless viewers have some prior knowledge of the period , they will quickly be lost . xxmaj in addition , the movie was obviously filmed simultaneously in xxmaj italian and xxmaj english with various actors being dubbed later . xxmaj at times , the actors seem as if they were in completely different movies which were then edited together . xxmaj in fact , this is not far wrong . xxmaj the actors were obviously pasted onto a cheesy computer generated ancient xxmaj rome . \n",

       "  xxmaj the only reason i give this boring mess any stars is because i always find xxmaj peter o'toole entertaining . xxmaj but that is no reason to rent it . xxmaj if you are curious about xxmaj roman history , there are much better movies available .,xxbos xxmaj remember those terrible war movies your grandmother forced you to watch 25 or so years ago on your old xxup vhs recorder ? \" xxmaj the xxmaj fallen \" is just a bad executed remake of those movies ! xxmaj the story is terrible , the direction is terrible , the editing is terrible , the music is terrible , and all together make an unbearable nightmare . \n",

       "  xxmaj press the eject button xxup now and you wo nt regret it !,xxbos a post - apocalyptic warrior goes off to save some kind of xxmaj nun and on the way meets some cyber - punks on skates who want to kick his ass . xxmaj this is one of the hardest to watch films ever , xxmaj there are scenes with silence that seems to last hours before somebody comes out with the next badly written , badly acted line . xxmaj there are action sequences that keep repeating - and we 're not talking the quickfire 1 - 2 - 3 action repeat on a particularly good kick that was made popular by eastern directors , we 're talking many , many repeats of long , bad fight sequences . xxmaj this is incredibly confusing at first but then quickly becomes annoying as you 're watching a 30 second sequence for the 2nd , 3rd and 4th time . xxmaj any kind of plot or vision is lost within the confusing continuity , the only thing that s keeps this film in the xxunk ( apart from the bet from a friend that i could n't watch it all the way through without begging for it to be turned off and disposed off safely so it may harm no - one else ) is the fact that although painful , this film is unintentionally hilarious , i 'm not at all a fan of those \" so bad that it 's funny \" type of films but at parts i was in tears . xxmaj other points to note are the quality of the sound and picture but this is forgiveable as it 's obvious money was a major problem in the making of this film . xxmaj final verdict - xxmaj king of the \" so bad they 're funny \" genre , anybody having that kind of genre video night should get themselves a copy . xxmaj also lets not forget that it is actually the worst film i 've ever seen .,xxbos i believe that this movie was a terrible waste of my time , and i would know after watching it 5 times in class . this movie does not show what absolutely perfectly happened during these times . no one can truly say that these things happened to the letter . if anything the only good part would be the actors , even tho that they were really really xxunk were reading the script without expression . quite boring . i would rather watch play school . so i would definitely like to never ever see this movie again in my whole life . it is a complete waste of time unless you want your time to be wasted and if you would like to see an unrealistic view of what happened back in 1981 .\n",
