# ## Trouble installing fastai library?

# %% [markdown] hidden=true
# Here is a [guide to troubleshooting](https://docs.fast.ai/troubleshoot.html) problems with fastai installation.  By far, the most common problem is having fastai installed for a different environment/different Python installation than the one your Jupyter notebook is using (you can have Python installed in multiple places on your computer and not even realize it!). Or, you might have different versions of fastai installed in your different environments/different Python installations (and the one you are running in Jupyter notebook could be out of date, even if you installed version 1.0 somewhere else). For both of these problems, please [see this entry](https://docs.fast.ai/troubleshoot.html#modulenotfounderror-no-module-named-fastaivision).

# ## More detail about randomized SVD

# %% [markdown] hidden=true
# I didn't cover how randomized SVD worked, because we aren't going to learn about it in detail in this course.  The main things I want you to know about randomized SVD are:
# - **it is fast**
# - **it gives us a truncated SVD** (whereas with traditional SVD, we are usually throwing away small singular values and their corresponding columns)
#
# If you were curious to know more, two keys are:
# - It is often useful to be able to reduce dimensionality of data in a way that preserves distances. The Johnsonâ€“Lindenstrauss lemma is a classic result of this type.  [Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma): a small set of points in a high-dimensional space can be embedded into a space of much lower dimension in such a way that distances between the points are nearly preserved (proof uses random projections).
# - We haven't found a better general SVD method, we'll just use the method we have on a smaller matrix.  
#
# Below is an over-simplified version of `randomized_svd` (you wouldn't want to use this in practice, but it covers the core ideas).  The main part to notice is that we multiply our original matrix by a smaller random matrix (`M @ rand_matrix`) to produce `smaller_matrix`, and then use our same `np.linalg.svd` as before:
#
# ```
# def randomized_svd(M, k=10):
#     m, n = M.shape
#     transpose = False
#     if m < n:
#         transpose = True
#         M = M.T
#         
#     rand_matrix = np.random.normal(size=(M.shape[1], k))  # short side by k
#     Q, _ = np.linalg.qr(M @ rand_matrix, mode='reduced')  # long side by k
#     smaller_matrix = Q.T @ M                              # k by short side
#     U_hat, s, V = np.linalg.svd(smaller_matrix, full_matrices=False)
#     U = Q @ U_hat
#     
#     if transpose:
#         return V.T, s.T, U.T
#     else:
#         return U, s, V
# ```
#
# This code snippet is from this [randomized-SVD jupyter notebook](https://github.com/fastai/randomized-SVD/blob/master/Randomized%20SVD.ipynb) which was the demo I used for my PyBay talk on [Using randomness to make code much faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i6kBz1kZ-A&list=PLtmWHNX-gukLQlMvtRJ19s7-8MrnRV6h6&index=7).

# ## Bayes Theorem

# %% [markdown] hidden=true
# Ex: Physicist Leonard Mlodinow tested positive for HIV in 1989.  
# 	His doctor said there was a 99.9% chance he had HIV.  
#    
# A = positive test results		
# B = having HIV
#
#
# True positives: 	$P(A|B) = 99.9\%$	
#
# Prevalence:	$P(B)= 0.01\%$
#
# False positives:	$P(A|B^C) = 0.1\%$	
#
# Was his doctor correct?

# ## Derivation of Naive Bayes

# %% [markdown] hidden=true
# We want to calculate the probability that the review "I loved it" is positive.  Using Bayes Theorem, we can rewrite this:

# %% [markdown] hidden=true
# $$ P(\text{pos} | \text{"I"}, \text{"loved"}, \text{"it"}) = \frac{P(\text{"I"}, \text{"loved"}, \text{"it"}, | \text{pos}) \cdot P(\text{"loved"} | \text{pos}) \cdot P(\text{"it"} | \text{pos}) \cdot P(\text{pos})}{P(\text{"I"}, \text{"loved"}, \text{"it})}$$
#
# The "naive" part of Naive Bayes is that we will assume that the probabilities of the different words are all independent.
#
# $$ P(\text{pos} | \text{"I"}, \text{"loved"}, \text{"it"}) = \frac{P(\text{"I"} | \text{pos}) \cdot P(\text{"loved"} | \text{pos}) \cdot P(\text{"it"} | \text{pos}) \cdot P(\text{pos})}{P(\text{"I"}, \text{"loved"}, \text{"it})}$$

# %% [markdown] hidden=true
# We do the same calculation to see how likely it is the review is negative, and then choose whichever is larger.

# %% [markdown] hidden=true
# $$ P(\text{neg} | \text{"I"}, \text{"loved"}, \text{"it"}) = \frac{P(\text{"I"} | \text{neg}) \cdot P(\text{"loved"} | \text{neg}) \cdot P(\text{"it"} | \text{neg}) \cdot P(\text{neg})}{P(\text{"I"}, \text{"loved"}, \text{"it})}$$

# %% [markdown] hidden=true
# We will add one to avoid dividing by zero (or something close to it).  Similarly, we take logarithms to avoid multiplying by a lot of tiny values.  For the reasons we want to avoid this, please see the next section on numerical stability:

# ## Numerical Stability

# %% [markdown] hidden=true
# #### Exercise

# %% [markdown] hidden=true
# Take a moment to look at the function $f$ below.  Before you try running it, write on paper what the output would be of $x_1 = f(\frac{1}{10})$.  Now, (still on paper) plug that back into $f$ and calculate $x_2 = f(x_1)$.  Keep going for 10 iterations.
#
# This example is taken from page 107 of *Numerical Methods*, by Greenbaum and Chartier.

# %% hidden=true
def f(x):
    if x <= 1/2:
        return 2 * x
    if x > 1/2:
        return 2*x - 1

# Only after you've written down what you think the answer should be, run the code below:

x = 1/10
for i in range(80):
    print(x)
    x = f(x)

# ### Problem: math is continuous & infinite, but computers are discrete & finite

# %% [markdown] hidden=true
# Two Limitations of computer representations of numbers:
# 1. they can't be arbitrarily large or small
# 2. there must be gaps between them
#
# The reason we need to care about accuracy, is because computers can't store infinitely accurate numbers.  It's possible to create calculations that give very wrong answers (particularly when repeating an operation many times, since each operation could multiply the error).

# %% [markdown] hidden=true
# How computers store numbers:

# The *mantissa* can also be referred to as the *significand*.

# IEEE Double precision arithmetic:
# - Numbers can be as large as $1.79 \times 10^{308}$ and as small as $2.23 \times 10^{-308}$.
# - The interval $[1,2]$ is represented by discrete subset: 
# $$1, \: 1+2^{-52}, \: 1+2 \times 2^{-52},\: 1+3 \times 2^{-52},\: \ldots, 2$$
#
# - The interval $[2,4]$ is represented:
# $$2, \: 2+2^{-51}, \: 2+2 \times 2^{-51},\: 2+3 \times 2^{-51},\: \ldots, 4$$

# **Machine Epsilon**
#
# Half the distance between 1 and the next larger number. This can vary by computer.  IEEE standards for double precision specify $$ \varepsilon_{machine} = 2^{-53} \approx 1.11 \times 10^{-16}$$

# %% [markdown] hidden=true
# **Two important properties of Floating Point Arithmetic**:
#
# - The difference between a real number $x$ and its closest floating point approximation $fl(x)$ is always smaller than $\varepsilon_{machine}$ in relative terms.  For some $\varepsilon$, where $\lvert \varepsilon \rvert \leq \varepsilon_{machine}$, $$fl(x)=x \cdot (1 + \varepsilon)$$
#
# - Where * is any operation ($+, -, \times, \div$), and $\circledast$ is its floating point analogue,
#     $$ x \circledast y = (x * y)(1 + \varepsilon)$$
# for some $\varepsilon$, where $\lvert \varepsilon \rvert \leq \varepsilon_{machine}$
# That is, every operation of floating point arithmetic is exact up to a relative error of size at most $\varepsilon_{machine}$

# ## Speed of different types of memory

# %% [markdown] hidden=true
# This course is 90% NLP and 10% things I want to make sure you see before the end of your MSDS.

# %% [markdown] hidden=true
# Here are some *numbers everyone should know* (from the legendary [Jeff Dean](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/people/jeff/stanford-295-talk.pdf)):
# - L1 cache reference 0.5 ns
# - L2 cache reference 7 ns
# - Main memory reference/RAM 100 ns
# - Send 2K bytes over 1 Gbps network 20,000 ns
# - Read 1 MB sequentially from memory 250,000 ns
# - Round trip within same datacenter 500,000 ns
# - Disk seek 10,000,000 ns
# - Read 1 MB sequentially from network 10,000,000 ns
# - Read 1 MB sequentially from disk 30,000,000 ns
# - Send packet CA->Netherlands->CA 150,000,000 ns
#
# And here is an updated, interactive [version](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~rcs/research/interactive_latency.html), which includes a timeline of how these numbers have changed.
#
# **Key take-away**: Each successive memory type is (at least) an order of magnitude worse than the one before it.  Disk seeks are **very slow**.

# ## Revisiting Naive Bayes in an Excel Spreadsheet
